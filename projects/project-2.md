Alongside the Key Club Convention planning I, along with a few other students, was asked to help plan our school's talent show performance. As is tradition for the Kauai High School Key Club, any and every person going to the convention must participate in the talent show. For our club it's more about the combined effort we all put in to making a fun performance for everyone than actually winning the talent show. Leading up to my tenure as head coordinator for the talent show, Kauai High had won the talent show every year.
