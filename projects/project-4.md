For my ICS 314 Final Project, my classmates and I created the Musicians of Manoa app using Meteor as a starting base. Throughout our development process we used Discord as our primary means of communication. I created the Discord to make it easier for all of us to have discussions and keep up our lines of communication. Our first meeting went fairly well, everyone was decently motivated to work on the project and get a good grade on it. After that we had most of our meetings happen during class time to talk about any glaring issues and decide on responsibilities as we headed towards the next milestone. 

For our first milestone, everything went decently well. We were able to implement the browse functionality using the database I set up. Users could filter by instruments and music taste. Our landing page had paralax scrolling and looked quite nice. Our lines of communication were a bit cluttered as we had trouble talking to one of our recently added devs and getting him set up to contribute.

Our second milestone, we ran into a lot of timing issues where our communication suffered a little. There was a lot of back and forth concerning what responsibilities each of our team members were assigned to. Eventually we figured out how to properly use the GitHub issues section and assigned everyone their responsibilities so there wasn't as much confusion.

For our final milestone three, we worked for a while trying to fix bugs that somehow occurred during milestone two. When we realized one of our import lines got commented out by a group and one variable name was the only thing that was wrong we painfully laughed for a bit about it. We were able to finally implement the removal of events and the ability to see all the events created.


I learned quite a bit from this project about working in group projects, effective communication, organizing a group project, and delegating issue based project design. I feel confident that I could work using GitHub to create another project if I was placed in a group setting again.
